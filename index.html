<h1>PowerSet</h1>

<h3>The PowerSet Programming Language</h3>

<p>This language is currently a hobby project. It is incomplete and should not be relied upon.</p>

<p>The goal of PowerSet is to provide a language unifying the ability to write low-level code and the abstractions many high-level languages provide. The language's priorities include a focus on program correctness, as well as preserving the ability to write performance-optimized and systems-level code, without sacrificing developer ergonomics and abstraction.</p>

<p>The name is inspired by the idea that many programming tasks can use some subset of the languge's features, thus the language is the power set (set of all subsets) of all the programming paradigms and language features it contains.</p>

<p>The initial language spec is still under construction.</p>
